Meeting notes:
</br>
Before the meeting Zeeshan created the GitHub repository and Jordyn set up a recurring Zoom meeting.  A few members had the project running locally.
During the meeting we introduced ourselves, assigned roles, filled out the "member information" chart, and started collecting screenshots for the
Milestone 1 report.  We discussed what responsiblities each role would have, and made plans to create a Slack channel for easier communication.

Meeting notes:
</br>
Since the last meeting, all team members had gotten the project running locally, and many had started looking at the requirements for
Milestone 2.  During the meeting we brainstormed formal requirements and classes.  We also delegated the creation of class lists and use cases.
We are still a bit confused about how to format the formal requirements or what exactly needs to be included in the class list and diagram, 
so we scheduled an additional meeting for Tuesday.

Meeting notes:
</br>
Before our extra Tuesday meeting, most of the use case tables were finished.  On Tuesday, we made the component transition graph and the majority of the class diagram.  Small changes were made to the graphs and more use cases were added before our weekly Thursday meeting.  During the meeting we reviewed the Milestone 2 requirements, ensured all use cases were finished, and made small adjustments to the diagrams.  Since we cannot see Milestone 3 yet, our only objectives for next week are to submit Milestone 2 and wait for Milestone 3.

Meeting notes:
</br>
During this meeting we used the class diagram to create a set of features to implement.  We then split those features among the group.  Each person will be responsible
for one task, with the remaining couple being left for whoever finished their task early.  We also moved our weekly meeting time to 6.

Meeting notes:
</br>
Before the meeting most of the milestone tasks were either finished or close to finished.  During the meeting each member gave a brief update
on the progress they had made on their respective task and what they still needed to do.  We discussed how to solve the issue of passing services
that relied on database information between activities, and made minor updates to individual tasks.  We also figured out a merge flow that minimized
the number of conflicts and made it easier to solve the services issue.  We plan to meet on Saturday at 10 am central to make sure the app works and
record the milestone video.

Meeting notes:

Before the meeting we finished up Milestone 3 and started to look at the requirements for Milestone 4.  During the meeting
we split the milestone into 2 groups: map and weather.  We had a brief discussion over how to split the work up and 
which of the API options we wanted to use.

Meeting notes:
</br>
Before the meeting both the map and weather activities were completely functional, and most of the UI elements were finished.  During the meeting,
we went over progress and made sure all milestone requirements were met.  We also made minor changes to some of the visuals and text elements, and
changed the units that the weather api responded with to imperial.  We plan on making a few more aesthetic changes before submitting.

Meeting notes:

The group decided that a meeting right before break wasn't necessary, especially since half of use couldn't make it anyways.
Zeeshan and Catherine met and split up Milestone 5 into 6 tasks.  The rest of the group picked which task they wanted to work
on.

Meeting notes:

Before the meeting the login, authentication, and weather test cases were written.  During an extra meeting on Tuesday we went over the existing tests,
clarified who was working on the remaining tests, and tried to figure out how to test API connection status and what the extra milestone
requirements meant.  Before the Thursday meeting almost all the tests were done.  During the meeting we made sure all necessary tests were included or 
being worked on.
